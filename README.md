##
Personal repo for hosting files to successfully build Chromium 69 through 72 on Linux, or Windows.

M71 was the last version to sport the classic tabstrip and toolbar. (for 69 and above, you must change a flag to enable it)

Has a few patches and optimizations backported from [Thorium](https://thorium.rocks/).
